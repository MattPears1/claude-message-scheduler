TIME FORMAT GUIDE - Schedule Messages at Specific Times
======================================================

You can now enter EXACT TIMES instead of just delays!

EXAMPLES:
---------
13:30   = 1:30 PM today
9:00    = 9:00 AM (tomorrow if already past)
22:45   = 10:45 PM today
0:30    = 12:30 AM (tomorrow)

OLD FORMAT STILL WORKS:
----------------------
30s     = 30 seconds from now
5m      = 5 minutes from now
1h      = 1 hour from now
90      = 90 minutes from now

HOW IT WORKS:
------------
1. Press F9
2. Type your message
3. Enter time like "13:30" or delay like "5m"
4. If the time is already past (like entering 9:00 at 3 PM), 
   it automatically schedules for tomorrow

PERFECT FOR:
-----------
- "Send this at 3:30 PM when the meeting starts"
- "Send at 17:00 when work day ends"
- "Send at 9:00 tomorrow morning"

The scheduler shows both the exact time AND countdown!
